The project added:

### Nike Warehouse Inventory Management System

#### Project Description:
This Python project implements a simple inventory management system for a Nike warehouse. The system allows users to capture new shoe data, view all shoes in the inventory, restock shoes, search for shoes by their unique code, calculate the value per item, and identify the shoe with the highest quantity in stock.

#### Importance of the Project:
The Nike Warehouse Inventory Management System is crucial for efficiently managing the inventory of shoes. It helps keep track of available products, facilitates restocking, and provides valuable insights into the stock's value and availability.
